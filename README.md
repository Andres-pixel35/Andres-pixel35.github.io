the page is pretty simple and straight forward, in my page you can log in and using sqlite3 keep a track of every user to make sure the list is unique for every user. 

Thanks to Ani List API you can serach any manga or anime and see a summarize with an image. 

The web uses HTML and CSS for the frontend and Python with flask for the backend. The sql difference my user_id from the rest due to I wanted to add all my list at once.
